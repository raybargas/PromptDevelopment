## üéØ Product Manager Playbook

### Your Mission
**Lead product discovery, validate customer value, ensure stakeholder alignment, and hand off clear requirements to engineering.**

### Phase 1: Discovery with Mary

#### Getting Started
1. **Gather context before starting:**
   - Client focus group feedback
   - Prospect interviews and sales insights
   - Competitive research
   - Internal stakeholder perspectives

2. **Invoke Mary:**
   ```
   /analyst
   ```

3. **Start with elicitation (always):**
   - Mary will ask strategic questions
   - Be honest and comprehensive in your answers
   - Don't skip this‚Äîit surfaces unexpected insights

#### Key Activities During Discovery

**Answer Mary's questions about:**
- **Problem space:** What problem are we solving? For whom?
- **Users:** Who are they? What's their current workflow?
- **Goals:** What does success look like?
- **Constraints:** Technical, timeline, budget, resource limitations
- **Competition:** What exists today? How do we differentiate?

**Incorporate external insights:**
- Client pain points from focus groups
- Lost deal feedback from sales
- Competitive feature analysis
- Industry trends and best practices

#### Working with Mary's Outputs

**ProjectBrief.md**
- Review for accuracy on vision and problem statement
- Ensure target users are well-defined
- Validate business goals are measurable
- Confirm competitive context is accurate

**PRFAQ.md**
- Focus on customer value proposition
- Press release should be compelling to read
- FAQ should address key concerns
- Success metrics should be clearly defined

#### The Critical Gate: PRFAQ Ratification

**Why it matters:**
- This is "working backwards" methodology
- Validates customer value before building anything
- Prevents building the wrong thing
- Gets stakeholder buy-in early

**Who ratifies:**
- Executive leadership
- Product leadership
- Sales/success teams
- Key stakeholders

**The process:**
1. Schedule stakeholder review meeting
2. Present PRFAQ to all stakeholders
3. Gather honest feedback
4. Work with Mary to iterate
5. Achieve sign-off from all stakeholders
6. **DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 2 without ratification

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Vague or non-committal feedback
- Stakeholders who say "looks good" but don't engage
- Disagreement in the room that gets swept under the rug
- Missing key stakeholders in the review

### Phase 2: Project Formation & PRD Creation

#### Complete PRD with Mary
1. Continue working with Mary using `/analyst`
2. Request full PRD creation
3. Ensure PRD includes:
   - Comprehensive problem statement
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - User epics defined
   - Success criteria
   - Constraints and dependencies

#### Collaborate on Sharding
**Work with your pod to shard the PRD:**

**Principles:**
- Each shard = one buildable piece
- Number sequentially (01-, 02-, 03-...)
- Organize by user flow, component area, or build order
- Each shard needs:
  - Detailed requirements
  - Architectural approach (high-level)
  - Technical metadata

**Example sharding:**
For a Project Management Module:
- `01-project-creation.md` - Create projects
- `02-phase-management.md` - Manage phases
- `03-milestone-tracking.md` - Track milestones
- `04-member-management.md` - Manage members
- `05-work-items.md` - Create work items

**Validate shards:**
- Review each shard for completeness
- Ensure no requirements are lost
- Verify sequencing makes sense
- Get team alignment

#### Handoff to Engineering
**Once shards are validated, hand off:**
- All sharded PRD documents
- Brief context on prioritization
- Any client constraints or special considerations
- Your availability for questions during spec review

### Phase 3 & 4: Stay Connected

#### Your Role During Implementation
**Watch, don't intervene:**
- Monitor Notion Progress Board
- Trust engineering to execute
- Only step in when blocked

**Client feedback loop:**
- Stay connected with clients as features ship
- Gather early feedback
- Prepare for iteration if needed

**No status meetings:**
- Notion Progress Board is your real-time status
- If something's blocked, you'll see it
- Spontaneous check-ins are fine

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Mary's questions seem off-topic**
- **Trust the process:** Elicitation surfaces unexpected insights
- **Answer honestly:** Mary needs the full picture
- **Stay patient:** Initial questions may seem basic but uncover nuance

**Scenario 2: Stakeholders want to skip PRFAQ ratification**
- **Push back:** This gate prevents costly mistakes
- **Explain:** "Working backwards" validates value before building
- **Provide data:** Show examples where skipping caused problems

**Scenario 3: Requirements aren't clear**
- **Go back to Mary:** Ask for more elicitation
- **Interview users:** Talk to actual users directly
- **Prototype:** Sometimes you need to see it to know what you want

**Scenario 4: Mid-project client request**
- **Assess scope:** Use entry point decision framework
- **Pod decides:** Collaborate with engineering on approach
- **Communicate timeline:** Set expectations with client

### Success Metrics
- PRFAQ ratified by all stakeholders
- Sharded PRDs complete and validated
- Zero "we built the wrong thing" moments
- Engineering has clear requirements to work from
