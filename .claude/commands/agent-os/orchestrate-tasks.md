# Process for Orchestrating a Spec's Implementation

Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with orchestrating implementation of each task group by a dedicated agent using the following MULTI-PHASE process.

Follow each of these phases and their individual workflows IN SEQUENCE:

## Multi-Phase Process

### FIRST: Get tasks.md for this spec

IF you already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder has a `tasks.md` file, then use that and skip to the NEXT phase.

IF you don't already know which spec we're working on and IF that spec folder doesn't yet have a `tasks.md` THEN output the following request to the user:

```
Please point me to a spec's `tasks.md` that you want to orchestrate implementation for.

If you don't have one yet, then run any of these commands first:
/shape-spec
/write-spec
/create-tasks
```

### NEXT: Create orchestration.yml to serve as a roadmap for orchestration of task groups

In this spec's folder, create this file: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/orchestration.yml`.

Populate this file with with the names of each task group found in this spec's `tasks.md` and use this EXACT structure for the content of `orchestration.yml`:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

### NEXT: Ask user to assign subagents to each task group

Next we must determine which subagents should be assigned to which task groups.  Ask the user to provide this info using the following request to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Please specify the name of each subagent to be assigned to each task group:

1. [task-group-name]
2. [task-group-name]
3. [task-group-name]
[repeat for each task-group you've added to orchestration.yml]

Simply respond with the subagent names and corresponding task group number and I'll update orchestration.yml accordingly.
```

Using the user's responses, update `orchestration.yml` to specify those subagent names.  `orchestration.yml` should end up looking like this:

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  - name: [task-group-name]
    claude_code_subagent: [subagent-name]
  # Repeat for each task group found in tasks.md
```

For example, after this step, the `orchestration.yml` file might look like this (exact names will vary):

```yaml
task_groups:
  - name: authentication-system
    claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
  - name: user-dashboard
    claude_code_subagent: frontend-specialist
  - name: api-endpoints
    claude_code_subagent: backend-specialist
```


### NEXT: Delegate task groups implementations to assigned subagents

Loop through each task group in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and delegate its implementation to the assigned subagent specified in `orchestration.yml`.

For each delegation, provide the subagent with:
- The task group (including the parent task and all sub-tasks)
- The spec file: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- Instruct subagent to:
  - Perform their implementation
  - Check off the task and sub-task(s) in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`
