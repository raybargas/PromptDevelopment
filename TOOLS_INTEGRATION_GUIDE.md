- **Engineering:** Code progress syncs from GitHub to Notion
- **Mary:** Can read and update PRD boards
- **Agent-OS:** Updates progress boards automatically

**Two boards per project:**

**PRD Board (Notion = Source of Truth)**
- Houses PRDs and sharded component PRDs
- Sync: Notion ‚Üí GitHub
- PM makes changes here
- Engineers read from GitHub

**Progress Board (GitHub = Source of Truth)**
- Displays Agent-OS roadmap tasks and progress

**How agents use it:**
- **Agent-OS:** Reads specs, writes code, updates roadmaps
- **Mary:** Can read existing documentation
- **Sync:** Notion PRDs ‚Üí GitHub specs
- **Sync:** GitHub progress ‚Üí Notion board

**Repository structure:**
```
agent-os/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/                    # Generated specs per component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product/                  # Project configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mission.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roadmap.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-stack.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ standards/                # Templates (don't edit)
```
